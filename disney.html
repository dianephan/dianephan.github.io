            <p>Growing up, I learned to appreciate the importance of storytelling and giving back to the organizations that helped mold me into the person I am today. Thus, Disney is one of the companies with a mission that I feel deeply connected with. Their reputation of engaging the world with an immersive experience has inspired me to be a part of the magic and help build the future of Disney. 
                <br>
                <br>

                As a programmer, I enjoy working on the backend of the tech stack, as it provides a way for me to gain a deeper understanding of computer science topics, as well as the opportunity to come up with creative solutions and designs for data visualization. 
                As Disney is emerging to become the leading competitor in the video streaming market, I would like to share my leadership and data analyzing skills to assist in business making decisions so that Disney can stay on top. 
                <br>
                <br>

                Ultimately, I want my impact to encourage the younger generations to take the same footsteps as me by continuing to tackle challenging problems in unique ways, and hopefully pursue technology in the entertainment industry.
